Familiarity with screen sharing, breakout rooms, captioning, and recording in Zoom is expected. Optional but recommended tools include an SSH client or VPN for connecting to campus HPC resources and a PDF reader that supports annotation.

These are meant to provide an opportunity to more deeply understand concepts and put them into practice and provide an opportunity for data manipulation. This is part of the ‘lab’ component of the course and you will be given time in class to work on assignments and collaborate. However, these problem sets will take substantial time outside of class to complete, so please plan accordingly.\n\n\nResearch Project\nStudents will choose a unique project to work on for the final third of the semester. At the end of the semester, students will submit a written project report in the form of a scientific research paper. Students are strongly encouraged to work in groups of up to three on their projects, however such groups will be expected to make proportionally more substantial contributions with clearly delineated responsibilities for each member’s contributions. Projects should be based on a research topic related to statistical genetics, but can be computational, methodological, or applied in nature. The Lab write-ups will follow the standard form of a scientific paper to gain experience in writing. Specifically, we will follow the format of the journal Genetics, the leading journal in the field. The paper MUST BE BASED ON THE PRIMARY LITERATURE IN THE APPROPRIATE REFEREED SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, and it should adhere to the following format:\n\nBegin the paper with an original title, followed by your name, the course, and the date. All papers should be typed, single-spaced, and in 12 pt. font.\nThe paper should have the following sections:\n\nIntroduction – here you state the general problem or issue you are addressing.\nMaterials and Methods – describe the methods used to obtain data, analyze data, and test hypotheses associated with the data.\nResults – describe the results of the data analysis and hypothesis testing.\nDiscussion – here you draw conclusions about the problem you studied; this section should include a synthesis of ideas.\nLiterature Cited – List the relevant literature you have read and used to support your arguments/analyze your data. The literature cited should be in the format of the journal Genetics.\n\n\nAspects of the project will be required throughout the course with a final research project submitted in the form of a research paper during finals.
