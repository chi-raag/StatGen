## Purpose

- Analyze real genetic data using methods from the course. Choose one of the tracks below (or propose your own) and produce a succinct, reproducible analysis using a public dataset.
- This project emphasizes scientific reasoning, correct statistical practice, clear communication, and reproducible code. It is intentionally open‑ended: depth > breadth.

## Deliverables

- Project proposal (approx. 1 page): question(s), dataset(s), methods, risks/mitigations, expected outputs. **Due: Wednesday, October 15th by 11:59pm.** 
  - Ensure that you are able to access/download your proposed dataset(s)
- Final report (8–12 pages, PDF only): format details below. **Due: Wednesday, November 12th by 11:59pm.**
  - Reproducible materials: a self‑contained folder or repo with your `.qmd`/R scripts, environment notes, and seeds. Include a `README` with run instructions.
- 8–10 minute in‑class presentation of key results on **Wednesday, November 12th**

## Format

We will follow the format of the journal [Genetics](https://academic.oup.com/genetics). An Overleaf template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-preparing-your-submission-to-genetics-using-overleaf/stmpddtqcxtx). The paper should adhere to the following:

-   Begin the paper with an original title, followed by your name, the course, and the date
-   The paper should have the following sections:
    -   Introduction: state the general problem or issue you are addressing.
    -   Materials and Methods: describe the methods used to obtain data, analyze data, and to test hypotheses associated with the data.
    -   Results: describe the results of the data analysis and hypothesis testing.
    -   Discussion: here you draw conclusions about the problem you studied; this section should include a synthesis of ideas.
    -   References: List the relevant literature you have read and used to support your arguments/analyze your data. The literature cited should be in the format of the journal Genetics.

## Evaluation (20% of course grade)

- Clarity and scope (20%): well‑posed question, appropriate scope for time/resources.
- Methods and correctness (35%): sound statistical modeling, assumptions stated, correct inference, sensible QC.
- Interpretation and communication (25%): figures/tables support claims, limitations, ethical awareness.
- Reproducibility (20%): organized code, seeds, instructions, figures regenerate.

## Example Topics

- Primary GWAS analysis (individual-level data): perform QC, PCA, GWAS, and post-GWAS analyses. Data is typically available for non-human model organisms.
- Secondary GWAS analysis (summary statistics): pick one trait and perform quality checks, Manhattan plot, locus zoom(s), gene/annotation enrichment, and short literature triangulation, SNP‑heritability via LD Score Regression, cross‑trait genetic correlation.
- Population structure and diversity: PCA/UMAP on a reference genotype panel, compute $F_{ST}$ between populations, visualize allele frequency spectra, explore LD decay, ADMIXTURE/LEA ancestry components.
- Causal inference with two‑sample Mendelian randomization: select a well‑powered exposure/outcome with strong instruments, run multiple MR estimators, perform sensitivity and heterogeneity checks, discuss assumptions and violations.
- Fine‑mapping or colocalization: focus on 1–2 loci, use LD from a reference panel, apply SuSiE/FINEMAP, test GWAS–eQTL colocalization for a tissue of interest.
- Simulation with real LD: simulate phenotypes on a real genotype panel (e.g., chromosome 22) to study power, inflation, or PRS performance under different architectures.

## Ethics & Responsible Use

- Use population labels with care
- Avoid essentialist interpretations
- Discuss portability and fairness when comparing groups
- Do not attempt re‑identification
- Respect each dataset’s license/terms.
