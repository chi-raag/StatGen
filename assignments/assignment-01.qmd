2.  (Laird, 2.4) How many genotypes are possible with a 3-allele marker? With K alleles?

3.  (Laird, 2.6) Consider a recessive Mendelian disease, where in the population, $P(\text{an individual has 2 disease variants}) = 0.000001$.

    a.  What is the probability that a randomly selected person is affected? Suppose that the randomly selected person is affected. What does that imply about the probability that their sibling is also affected (you can assume that having either one or two parents with two variants is so rare that you can ignore them)?

    b.  Now answer both of these questions assuming the penetrance is only 12, i.e., $P(\text{disease} | 2 \text{ variants}) = 12$, but the phenocopy rate is still zero.

3.  Consider a sample size of $n$ of unrelated haploid individuals is obtained from some population with the objective of estimating allele frequency at a biallelic locus. The sample contains $x$ copies of $A$, and $n-x$ copies of $a$.

    a.  Plot the probability distribution of $X$ given $n = 30$, and $\theta = .1$. Plot the probability distribution of $X$ given $n = 1000$, and $\theta = .1$.
    b.  Lets say we observed $30$ samples, with $10$ copies of allele $A$. Plot the likelihood function for $\theta$
    c.  What is the MLE of $\theta$?
    d.  Let's say $n = 1000$, and $x = 100$. What is the sampling variance of $\hat{\theta}$?
    e.  Let's say $n = 100$, and $x = 10$. What is the sampling variance of $\hat{\theta}$? Why is this different than the result above?

4. Refer to equations (1.3) and (1.5) in Sorensen. Say you observe $8$ individuals, and $1$ copies of genotype $A$. Assume that $A$ is binomially distributed with parameter $\theta$. 
  a. Compute $\hat{\theta}$
  a. Compute $\hat{\text{Var}}(\hat{\theta})$
  a. Provide a 95% Wald confidence interval for $\theta$
  a. Write an interpretation of this confidence interval. What problem does this reveal about the Wald confidence interval?
